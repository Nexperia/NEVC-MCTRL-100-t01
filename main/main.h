   \brief Desired Switching Frequency for MOSFET Gate Signals

   This macro defines the desired switching frequency for the MOSFET gate
   signals. The resolution of the duty cycle is changes with the selected
   switching frequency. The best pre-scaler is chose to provide the best
   resolution.

  The absolute PWM Resolution is calculated using the following formula: \f[
   \text{Absolute PWM Resolution (%)} = \frac{100}{(F_{HST} / (TIM4_{FREQ}
   \times TIM4_{PRESCALER} \times 2)) - 1} \f]

  Where:
    - \ref F_HST : High-speed system clock frequency, configured to be 64 MHz.
    - \ref  TIM4_FREQ : The required gate switching frequency.
    - TIM4_PRESCALER : The pre-scaler value, which depends on the gate switching
      frequency as explained below.

  The TIM4 Pre-scaler is selected based on the gate switching frequency (\ref
  TIM4_FREQ):
    - For frequencies \f$\geq\f$ 31250 Hz, the pre-scaler is set to 1.
    - For frequencies < 31250 Hz and \f$\geq\f$ 15625 Hz, the pre-scaler is set
      to 2.
    - For frequencies < 15625 Hz and \f$\geq\f$ 7813 Hz, the pre-scaler is set
      to 4.

   \brief Dead Time Specification

   This macro specifies the desired dead time between switching actions in

   \brief Current Warning Threshold (Register Value)

   This macro specifies the threshold value for current warning as a register
   value. When the current measured by the controller exceeds this threshold, it
   triggers the fault LED to be turned on.

   The range is 0-1023.

   This value is not scaled and represents the raw register value. To obtain the
   register value from the current in amperes, you can use the formula:

   \f[ \text{Register Value} = \frac{\text{CURRENT} \times
      \text{CURRENT_SENSE_RESISTOR} \times \text{CURRENT_GAIN}}{0.004887586
      \times 1000000} \f]

     - 0.004887586 : The conversion factor for a 10-bit ADC with a Vref of 5V.
     - \ref CURRENT_GAIN : The gain of the current sense operational amplifier.
     - \ref CURRENT_SENSE_RESISTOR : The value of the shunt resistor in
       micro-ohms (μΩ).

   The NEVB-3INV-001-01 comes with a current op-amp with a gain factor of 50 and
   a current sense resistor of value 2 mΩ. This corresponds to approximately
   0.049 amperes (A) per register value. The default value is 408 which
   corresponds to approximately 20 A.

   \brief Current Error Threshold (Register Value)

   This macro specifies the threshold value for current error as a register
   value. When the current measured by the controller exceeds this threshold, it

  This project is focused on the implementation of motor control, specifically
  designed for Brushless DC (BLDC) motors using Hall Effect sensors on the
  [Leonardo](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/leonardo) board or the
  [ATMEGA32u4](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/atmel-7766-8-bit-avr-atmega16u4-32u4_datasheet.pdf)
  micro controller, platforms widely recognized under the Arduino Leonardo
  nomenclature when operated through the Arduino IDE.

  This documentation documents the data structures, functions, variables,
  defines, enums, and typedefs in the code designed for the motor driver kit
  NEVB-MCTRL-100-01-3INV-001-01 which provides a full motor drive solution for
  3-phase BLDC motors. Support for brushless DC motors shall be implemented
  later. Specifically, the code is to work with NEVB-MCTRL-100-01 accompanied
  with any 3-phase inverter modules. In this kit, this is the NEVB-3INV-001-01,
  which contains PCBs designed for the [Nexperia LFPAK 5x6 MOSFET
  family](https://www.nexperia.com/products/mosfets/family/LFPAK56-MOSFETS/).

/*! \page features Features

   The firmware provides an Arduino compatible, or specifically the ATMEGA32u4
   AVR micro controller, trapezoidal control of brushless DC (BLDC) motors using
   Hall Effect sensors. Most important it's all open-source. 

   Specific features are discussed below:

   \section motor_configuration Motor Configuration
   - Configurable motor poles (\ref MOTOR_POLES).
   - Configurable switching frequency for MOSFET gate signals (\ref TIM4_FREQ).
   - Adjustable dead time between switching actions (\ref DEAD_TIME).
   - Option to enable or disable internal pull-up resistors on hall sensor
     inputs (\ref HALL_PULLUP_ENABLE).
   - Motor emulation capability by generating hall effect sensor inputs (\ref
     EMULATE_HALL).
   - Configurable electrical rotational frequency for emulated motor (\ref
     TIM3_FREQ).
   - Threshold for determining when the motor is considered stopped (\ref
     COMMUTATION_TICKS_STOPPED).
   - Selectable turn-off mode (coast or brake) (\ref TURN_OFF_MODE).

   \section drive_controls Drive Controls
   - Slow ramp up or down when turning on the motor or changing the speed
     reference input. (Not when turning it off as this depends on the turn-off
     mode.) 
   - Set the direction of rotation of the motor using input buttons.
   - Enable/disable the motor using input buttons.
   - Easily set a duty cycle or speed based on choice of speed control.

   \section current_monitor Current Monitor
   - Adjustable current gain factor (\ref CURRENT_GAIN).
   - Configuration of the resistance value of the current sense resistor (\ref
     CURRENT_SENSE_RESISTOR).
   - Threshold values for current warning and error conditions (\ref
     CURRENT_WARNING_THRESHOLD, \ref CURRENT_ERROR_THRESHOLD).
   - Option to enable or disable action when the current error threshold is
     exceeded (\ref CURRENT_FAULT_ENABLE).

   \section speed_control Speed Control
   - Selection between open-loop and closed-loop speed control (\ref
     SPEED_CONTROL_METHOD).
   - Adjustable parameters for PID controller in closed-loop control (\ref
     PID_K_P, \ref PID_K_I, \ref PID_K_D_ENABLE, \ref PID_K_D).
   - Maximum speed for closed-loop control (\ref SPEED_CONTROLLER_MAX_SPEED).
   - Parameters for both speed control (\ref SPEED_CONTROLLER_TIME_BASE, \ref
     SPEED_CONTROLLER_MAX_DELTA).

   \section scpi_implementation SCPI Implementation
   - Implementation of SCPI protocol for remote control and communication.
   - Definable SCPI input buffer length, error queue size, and command strings.
   - Implementation of SCPI commands for motor control, error handling, and
     system information.
   - SCPI commands for measuring motor speed, current, direction, and gate
     voltage.
   - Commands for querying motor enable state, direction, and configuration.

   \section error_handling_and_reporting Error Handling and Reporting

/*! \page quickstart Quick Start

  The project code is set up to be used with the Arduino IDE. To learn more
  about the the Leonardo hardware and software tools, go to Arduino's [getting
  started
  page](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/getting-started-arduino).

  \section quickstartinstall Uploading the Code

  1. Install Arduino IDE [v1](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1) or
     [v2](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2). Alternatively, you can also
     use [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
     [Arduino
     extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino)
     installed.

  2. Download and unzip a copy of the latest version of the code provided for
     this project.

  3. In this example, Arduino IDE v1 is used. Open main.ino with Arduino IDE.

  4. If this is the first time you are running the code with the motor provided
     in the kit, then you do not have to modify any parameters unless other
     parameters are preferred. To make changes to the the configuration for your
     particular motor, head to the \ref todo section to see the list of changes
     recommended.

  5. Select the appropriate board, in this case Leonardo, from Tools > Board,
     the correct port from Tools > Port, and ensure the programmer is set to
     AVRISP mkII under Tools > Programmer.

  6. Click on the "Upload" button to compile and upload the code to the Leonardo
     development board.

  \section quickstartrun Operating the Board

  \note Before powering on the system, it's essential to refer to the user
  manual for specific setup instructions related to the Nexperia's BLDC
  evaluation kit. The manual provides critical information on how to properly
  configure and prepare the system for operation. Also, refer to the \ref safety
  page.

  After ensuring that the setup is in accordance with the manual, power on the
  system. The motor control program will start, enabling the control and
  operation of the BLDC motor using the Hall Effect sensors.

  \section quickstartnext Next Steps

  \subsection quickstartchanges1 Making configuration changes

  Making simple configuration changes can be done by changing the \ref
  UserSettable in the motor header file, \ref main.h. These are also summarized
  in the \ref todo section. 

  \subsection quickstartchanges2 Making code changes

  Making any further changes to the code will require understanding of the whole
  code base and it is recommended to read through the documentation completely. 

  \subsection quickstartscpi Using SCPI

  The code supports basic implementation of SCPI allowing remote control by
  serial communication. To understand how to use this feature, please refer to
  the SCPI pages.

/*! \page safety Safety Precautions

  - **Motor Handling**: Ensure that the motor is securely clamped down and
    cannot move unexpectedly during operation. This is crucial to prevent any
    accidents or damage to the system.

  - **Operating Ranges**: Verify that the motor's intended operating ranges
    (voltage, current, speed, etc.) are supported by your setup. Operating the
    motor outside its specified limits can lead to malfunction or damage.

  - **Power Isolation**: Implement appropriate measures to quickly and safely
    isolate the power to the system if needed. This might include emergency stop
    mechanisms or easily accessible power switches.

  - **General Safety**: Always take reasonable safety precautions when handling
    electronic components. This includes wearing protective gear as necessary,
    ensuring a tidy and organized workspace, and being cautious of potential
    electrical hazards.

    This page lists all the macros that can be set by the user to quickly modify
    operating parameters such as switching frequencies and speed control
    methods. If this is the first time you are running the code with the motor
    provided in the kit, then you do not have to modify the parameters unless
    other parameters are preferred.
