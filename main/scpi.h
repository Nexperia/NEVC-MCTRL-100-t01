        SCPI implementation header file.

   \details
        This file contains all the defines for configurations and function prototypes
        related to the SCPI implementation.

        This file depends on the base [SCPI parser library v2](https://github.com/j123b567/scpi-parser)
        (commit #[4e87990](https://github.com/j123b567/scpi-parser/tree/4e879901b51cbb43dab36dd83f95a23f1dbaa4c0))
        by Jan Breuer which was then ported by Scott Feister to the Arduino IDE,
        [SCPI Parser Arduino Library](https://github.com/sfeister/scpi-parser-arduino).

        Further modifications were made to the base library to allow for memory
        optimisation and support for the avr-gcc compiler.

     \section Introduction

     \subsection scpi_intro_overview Overview

     This project includes an implementation of the Standard Commands for
     Programmable Instruments (SCPI) protocol. SCPI is a widely-accepted
     standard for syntax and commands, designed to provide a uniform method of
     controlling test and measurement devices. For a quick overview of SCPI,
     please refer to \ref scpi_quick_guide "SCPI Quick Guide".

     This allows remote operation of the motor via any programming language or
     software compatible with SCPI.

     Please note the SCPI implementation in this project is intended primarily
     for evaluation purposes only.

     \subsection scpi_intro_compliance Compliance with Standards

     While our SCPI implementation adheres to the core principles of the SCPI
     standard and relevant IEEE standards, it is important to note that it may
     not fully comply with the full required specification. The implementation
     focuses on the essential commands and functionalities necessary for
     evaluation. For detailed command information, see \ref scpi_commands.

     \subsection scpi_intro_usage Using the SCPI Implementation

     The SCPI commands available in this project are designed to be intuitive
     and easy to use, adhering to the conventional SCPI syntax. Users familiar
     with SCPI will find the command structure familiar and straightforward. For
     those new to SCPI, ample documentation is provided to guide through the
     basic commands and their usage, as detailed in the \ref scpi_quick_guide
     and \ref scpi_commands pages.

     \subsection scpi_intro_customization Customization and Expansion

     The modular nature of our SCPI implementation allows for customization and
     expansion. Users with specific needs can extend or modify the existing
     command set. This flexibility is further detailed in the sections \ref
     scpi_quick_guide "SCPI Quick Guide" and \ref scpi_commands.

     \section scpi_quick_guide Quick Guide

     This guide provides a quick overview of SCPI and its usage.

     \subsection scpi_quick_guide_structure Command Structure

     SCPI commands typically follow a hierarchical structure resembling a file
     path, starting with a root and followed by nodes separated by colons or
     semicolons. For example: `MEASure:VOLTage:DC?`.

     - \b Root: Usually an abbreviation of the instrument function (e.g.,
       `MEASure`).
     - \b Nodes: Subcategories or actions within the function (e.g.,
       `MOTOr:SPEEd`).

     \subsection scpi_quick_guide_types Command Types

     There are two primary types of SCPI commands:

     - \b Queries: Request data or status from the instrument (e.g., `*IDN?`).
     - \b Settings: Configure the instrument or execute actions (e.g.,
       `CONFigure:MOTOr:ENABle`).

     \subsection scpi_quick_guide_syntax Syntax and Conventions

     - \b Case Insensitivity: SCPI commands are not case-sensitive.
     - \b Abbreviations: Commands can be abbreviated to the shortest unique
       string.
     - \b Query Suffix: Queries end with a question mark (`?`).
     - \b Command Separation: Multiple commands can be concatenated using a
       semicolon (`;`).

     \subsection scpi_quick_guide_command_forms Short and Long Forms of Commands

     From the command set documentation, you can deduce both the short and long
     forms of SCPI commands by examining the case used in the command syntax.

     For instance, take the command `CONFigure:MOTOr:ENABle`. The way it's
     written provides clues:

     - \b Long Form: The long form of the command is exactly as it's presented:
       `CONFigure:MOTOr:ENABle`. It is the complete, full-length command.
     - \b Short Form: The short form capitalizes only the minimum letters
       required to uniquely identify the command. Thus, for
       `CONFigure:MOTOr:ENABle`, the short form would be `CONF:MOT:ENAB`.

     This approach to determining short and long forms applies to all SCPI
     commands. The long form is always the full command, while the short form
     uses the least number of initial capitalized letters. This feature of SCPI
     provides a balance between readability and ease of typing, especially for
     users who interact with the commands frequently.

     \subsection scpi_quick_guide_examples Example Usage

     These examples demonstrate that SCPI commands are not case-sensitive and
     can be abbreviated to the shortest unique string:

     - Query the device identification: `*IDN?`
     - Set the motor direction: `CONFigure:MOTOr:DIREction FORWard`
     - Measure voltage: `MEASure:VOLTage:DC?`
     - Enable motor:
          - Standard command: `CONFigure:MOTOr:ENABle ON`
          - Mixed case: `conFigure:motOR:enabLE ON`
          - Abbreviated command: `CONF:MOT:ENAB ON`
          - Mixed case with abbreviation: `Conf:Mot:Enab ON`

     SCPI's flexibility with command syntax makes it user-friendly and adaptable
     to various styles of interaction.

     \subsection scpi_quick_guide_communication Communication

     SCPI commands are sent to the instrument via a communication interface,
     such as GPIB, USB, LAN, or RS-232.

     In this case, we are using a serial communication (like RS-232) via USB,
     and certain settings need to be correctly configured:

     - \b Baud Rate: Typically set to `115200` bits per second.
     - \b Line Ending: Use Line Feed (`LF`) as the line ending character.
     - \b Data Bits: Set the number of data bits to `8`.
     - \b Parity: Set parity to `None`.
     - \b Stop Bits: Use `1` stop bit.
     - \b DTR (Data Terminal Ready): Should be checked or enabled.
     - \b RTS (Request to Send): Should be checked or enabled.

     \note These were the only verified working configurations. If other
     configurations are to be used, please test and verify.

     After configuring these settings, the instrument processes the SCPI command
     and returns a response, especially for queries. This ensures reliable
     communication between the controlling system and the instrument.

     \subsection scpi_quick_guide_starting Starting with SCPI

     To start using SCPI:

     1. Connect to the instrument using a suitable interface.
     2. Send SCPI commands using the interface's communication protocol.
     3. Read responses from the instrument for queries.
     4. Use appropriate software or libraries that support SCPI communication.

     \subsection scpi_quick_guide_opportunities Opportunities

     SCPI provides a standardized and intuitive way to communicate with and
     control test and measurement equipment. Its uniform syntax across different
     devices simplifies the process of instrument automation and data
     acquisition.

     LabView is a popularly used in communicating with test and measurement
     equipment, and an example of LabView VI in the picture below shows the
     capabilities opportunities that the SCPI implementation can provide.

     \note This guide is a quick overview. For detailed SCPI specifications and
     commands, refer to the SCPI standard documentation.

     \subsection scpi_commands_conclusion Conclusion

     This document provides a comprehensive overview of the SCPI command sets
     implemented in the project. It covers various categories including IEEE
     mandated commands, required SCPI commands, status subsystem commands, and
     motor control commands. For uncertain or future commands, placeholders are
     provided.

     \warning Due to low memory, a smaller input buffer is used. This means it
     is preferred not to concatenate commands using a semicolon (`;`).
